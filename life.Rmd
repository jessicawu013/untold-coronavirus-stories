On Tuesday, March 10th, 2020, Harvard College students were instructed to move 
out of their dorms in 5 days. Here's how life patterns have changed since then.
```{r}

home_life <- boredom %>%
  left_join(dalgona, by = "Day") %>%
  left_join(hair, by = "Day") %>%
  left_join(bread, by = "Day") %>%
  tail(-44) %>%
  rename(date = Day) %>%
  pivot_longer(-date, names_to = "search", values_to = "frequency")

home_life %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = frequency, color = search)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=as.numeric(home_life$date[c(24, 25, 49)]),
                linetype=3, colour="black") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "What are people doing while at home?",
       subtitle = "Taking a look a Google Search trends",
       y = "Percent Frequency of Search \n\ Relative to Itself on March 10th",
