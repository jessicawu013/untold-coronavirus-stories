In light of the fact that African American communities have been hit harder by the coronavirus, which many suggest is related
to the disproportionate number of African Americans with lower incomes and pre-existing health conditions, this project takes
a look at median income and health insurance data to see if these factors give insight into the way economic inequality has
impacted the effect of COVID-19 on communities in the United States.
